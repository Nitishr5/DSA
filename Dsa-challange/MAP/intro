C++ Map..

A map stores elements in "key/value" pairs.

Elements in a map are:

Accessible by keys (not index), and each key is unique.
Automatically sorted in ascending order by their keys.
To use a map, you have to include the <map> header file:

// Include the map library
#include <map>

Create a Map
To create a map, use the map keyword, and specify the type of both the key and the value it should store within angle brackets <>. At last, specify the name of the map, like: map<keytype, valuetype> mapName:

Example
// Create a map called people that will store strings as keys and integers as values
map<string, int> people
