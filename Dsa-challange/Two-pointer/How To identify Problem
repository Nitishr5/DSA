🧠 Kaise Pahchaane Ki Two Pointer Lagana Hai?
✅ 1. Array Sorted Ya Sort Karke Kaam Karna Hai
Agar problem me array sorted hai ya sort karke solve karna hai, aur hum ek pair / triplet dhoond rahe hain → Two Pointer likely lagega.

🔹 Examples:
Find Pair with Target Sum in Sorted Array → Two Pointer

3Sum / 4Sum (Triplets/Quadruplets) → Fix + Two Pointer

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array → Slow/Fast Pointer (variant of Two Pointer)

✅ 2. Start from Both Ends
Agar tumhe array ke start aur end se simultaneously kuch process karna hai (like min/max, area, balance), to Two Pointer best hai.

🔹 Examples:
Container With Most Water

Palindrome Check

Reverse an Array / String

✅ 3. Index Based Comparison
Tumhe compare karna hai: arr[i] + arr[j] == target
Aur i < j ho — to mostly Two Pointer

✅ 4. Brute Force = O(n²) → Optimize to O(n) using 2 pointers
Jaise nested loops ki jagah tum O(n) me solve kar sakte ho by moving two pointers smartly.

🔁 Difference with Sliding Window:
Feature	Two Pointer	Sliding Window
Type	Two independent pointers	Window of size (fixed/variable)
When Used	Pairing, searching in sorted	Subarrays/substrings (continuous)
Fixed Size?	❌ Not necessarily	✅ Mostly yes
Movement	Move either/both as needed	Usually move right, shrink left

📌 Summary Table – Jab Two Pointer Lagta Hai:
Pattern	Use Two Pointer?	Note
Sorted Array	✅	Most two pointer questions
Searching Pair/Triplet/Quadruplet	✅	Like 2Sum, 3Sum, 4Sum
Palindrome Check	✅	Compare left and right
Reversing array/string	✅	Swap from ends
Finding Max Area (Container)	✅	Compare heights and move
Remove duplicates (Sorted)	✅	Slow/Fast pointer variation
